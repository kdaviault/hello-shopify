# Hello, Shopify!

<h3>Hi Mike!</h3>

<b>I'm Krista.</b> I haven't used GitHub before, but decided to check it out after seeing it referenced in the Senior Business Analyst position. It's a pretty fantastic collaboration tool, and I can see multiple uses for it beyond just software developer applications. It's kind of like a better-featured version of Microsoft's Track Changes functionality<sup>1</sup>!

That said, I'm a fairly basic coder (I've been teaching myself for a personal side project... not quite ready for launch, but getting there!), so will leave the fancy GitHub tricks for those actively collaborating at the moment.

On that note, <u>thanks for taking a look at my application and for considering me as a candidate!</u>

All the best,
<br>Krista

<sup>1</sup> <em>Track Changes is alright, and SharePoint's version control features are better, but this is a really neat iterative way of working.</em>
